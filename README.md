# JUMPERS

JUMPERS is a sprite-based, movement-focused 2D platformer similar to [Jump King](https://nexile.se/jump-king/). The game aims to combine comfortable platforming with a difficult jump mechanic to create a platformer that rewards forward thinking. Levels are simple but punishing, and use powerups to add variety. We used the Unity engine and C# to develop the game. Assets were taken online from various resources like itch.io, the Unity Store, and SoundCloud, and all fall within fair use.

## Prerequisites

The game must be ran on a windows, mac, or linux machine, preferably with an aspect ratio wider than 16:10 (although the game will be formatted correctly and will run perfectly with any aspect ratio or resolution. Any modern (or just non-ancient) hardware will run the game fine. 

## Run Instructions

Built game is in two parts, the [Final Build](https://github.com/mattbryanking/GVSU-CIS350-JUMPERS/blob/master/artifacts/game/Final%20Build.rar) and [Unity Player](https://github.com/mattbryanking/GVSU-CIS350-JUMPERS/blob/master/artifacts/game/UnityPlayer.rar). Download and unzip each, and place UnityPlayer.dll inside the Final Build folder, where the exe files are located. Once combined, click on CIS 350 Jumpers.exe and the game will start. Arrow keys will control menus, and WASD, arrow keys, and space bar will control gameplay. Q will reset you to the main menu, R will reset the level, and E will use any debuff powerups in your inventory.

NOTE: Losing focus of the title screen will destroy timing. Try not to click away or alt-tab while intro sequence is playing for best experience.
