# JUMPERS

We are planning to make a sprite-based, movement-focused 2D platformer similar to [Jump King](https://nexile.se/jump-king/). We are using the Unity engine, and are planning on using online assets for the project. As the project plan becomes clearer and more fleshed out, this descirption will be updated to reflect those advancements.

## Team Members and Roles

* [Matthew King](https://github.com/mattbryanking/CIS350-HW2-King) (Assets/Art, Music, Title Screen, Level Design)

## Prerequisites

The game must be ran on a windows machine, preferably with an aspect ratio wider than 16:10 (although the game will be formatted correctly and will run perfectly with any asepct ratio or resolution. Any modern (or just non-ancient) hardware will run the game fine. 

## Run Instructions

Built game is in two parts, the [Final Build]https://github.com/mattbryanking/GVSU-CIS350-JUMPERS/blob/master/artifacts/game/Final%20Build.rar and [Unity Player]https://github.com/mattbryanking/GVSU-CIS350-JUMPERS/blob/master/artifacts/game/UnityPlayer.rar. Download and unzip each, and place UnityPlayer.dll inside the Final Build folder, where the exe files are located. Once combined, click on CIS 350 Jumpers.exe and the game will start. Arrow keys will control menus, and WASD, arrow keys, and space bar will control gameplay. Q will reset you to the main menu, R will reset the level, and E will use any debuff powerups in your inventory.
