# 2D GAME

We are planning to make a sprite-based, movement-focused 2D platformer similar to [Jump King](https://nexile.se/jump-king/). We are using the Unity engine, and are planning on using online assets for the project. As the project plan becomes clearer and more fleshed out, this descirption will be updated to reflect those advancements.
