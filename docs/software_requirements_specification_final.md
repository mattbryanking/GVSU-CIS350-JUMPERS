# Overview

This is a requirements page to aid us in our creation of JUMPERS. There are two main sections for Functional and Non-Functional requirements, with further subsections categorizing each requirement. This document will be updated and expanded as time goes on and the scope of the project advances.

# Functional Requirements
1. Player Movement
    1. The player character shall stop moving and prepare to jump while the jump button is being pressed down, regardless of other keys pressed.
    2. The player character shall move horizontally with A and D, and shall jump with space bar.
    3. The player characterâ€™s anticipated jump direction shall change if the left or right movement keys are pressed while charging a jump.
    4. The player shall not be allowed to jump while in midair.
    5. The player shall not carry momentum through movement or jumps.
2. Level Design
    1. Levels shall not take more than 2 minutes to complete using the optimal path.
    2. Jumps shall not span more than 3 units high, or 4 units in length, unless under the influence of powerups
    3. Each level shall have a minimum of 5 coins, and a maximum of 20 coins available.
    4. colliding with a "kill box", "spike trap", or "slime" (death traps) shall kill the player, removing all powerups, and restarting the level
    5. Levels shall be completed by reaching, and colliding with a flag placed somewhere in the level
3. Character/Object Collision
    1. Character shall not fall through solid objects
    2. Background objects shall not have collision
    3. the player shall stay in the same spot on moving platforms
    4. powerups shall last throughout the entire level the player is currently on
    5. negative powerups shall be removed if the "clear debuff" powerup is used
    6. negative powerups have the chance to soft-lock the player, forcing them to restart the level through death

# Non-Functional Requirements
1. Player Movement

    2. There shall not be more than a 5-frame delay before pressing a key and starting the corresponding animation.

2. Level Design
    1. Some levels may require powerups to be completed.
