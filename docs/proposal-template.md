# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies

We are planning to use Unity for the bulk of our game. None of our team members have substantial experience in Unity, so this will serve as our first jump into the program. Given this, however, there may be things easier accomplished by other software / languages. For example, we may decide to use Java or Python for certain aspects of game logic. We may use audio engines like Adobe Audition or Audacity for sound design. We are planning to source our assets from free online databases like itch.io. If we are not satisfied with animations in those assets or if we can't find what we're looking for, we may need to use programs like Adobe Animator or Adobe Photoshop to work on them ourselves. Music will likely be made by a team member in software like FL Studio or Ableton Live.
