Team members: Matthew King,

# Introduction

In our project, we are aiming to create a 2d, movement-based vertical platformer. The recently released Nexile game [Jump King](https://nexile.se/jump-king/) will serve as our primary source of inspiration, and we will try to replicate several mechanics, but we hope to have our finished project have distinct mechanics and aesthetics that differentiate it from Jump King.

Our game will be focused on upwards traversal: scaling obstacles, landing on challengingly placed platforms, and progressing farther within a set amount of "stages" that flow into one another. Jumping will be the main (and possibly sole) method of achieving this. Holding down the designated jump button will charge the jump, causing a higher altitude when released. Jumping will also be directional, allowing the player to aim their jumps across the screen, but the method we will use to accomplish this has yet to be determined. Powerups are also something we aim to include down the line. Increasing your jump height and adding a double jump are ideas we already have for potential items/abilities, and we hope to include more as the project progresses. 

Art direction will largely depend on the assets we find, but we hope to shoot for a fantasy themed aesthetic: knights, shining armor, cobblestone overgrown by moss, swords and shields, etc. We will use a pixel art design to improve the speed and ease at which we stylize the game. Music will have a similarly retro sound, with simple MIDI melodies looping as the game progresses.

# Anticipated Technologies

We are planning to use Unity for the bulk of our game. None of our team members have substantial experience in Unity, so this will serve as our first jump into the program. Given this, however, there may be things easier accomplished by other software / languages. For example, we may decide to use Java or Python for certain aspects of game logic. We may use audio engines like Adobe Audition or Audacity for sound design. We are planning to source our assets from free online databases like itch.io. If we are not satisfied with animations in those assets or if we can't find what we're looking for, we may need to use programs like Adobe Animator or Adobe Photoshop to work on them ourselves. Music will likely be made by a team member in software like FL Studio or Ableton Live.   

# Method/Approach

We are planning on using an agile type aproach to our project. This way each of us can be working and testing different parts of the code/project. We want to be able to do hard coding and ad different sprites and music simultaniously. Agile allows each of us to be working on a different part of the project, as long as we tracking what were doing and keeping good notes it should make out life easier.

# Estimated Timeline

Our first major milestone will be creating a game with controls that we can use and like. Then we will want to add platforms and make them have good hitboxes with our sprite. Once we have a good base setup we will then have to design the levels and character arts. The baseline for the game will probably take a couple weeks, just learning the esystem then figuring out how to create controls for our character and platforms to jump on. The next step will probably be the bulk of the project, making an interesting to play game and having good level design with interesting but challenging platforming.

# Anticipated Problems

* Hard to use controls, not as responsive as expected
* Platform detection
* Unique and interesting level design
