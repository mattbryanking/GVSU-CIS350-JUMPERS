# Overview

This is a requirements page to aid us in our creation of JUMPERS. There are two main sections for Functional and Non-Functional requirements, with further subsections categorizing each requirement. This document will be updated and expanded as time goes on and the scope of the project advances.

# Functional Requirements
1. Player Movement
    1. The player character shall stop moving and prepare to jump while the jump button is being pressed down, regardless of other keys pressed.
    2. The player character shall move horizontally with A and D, and shall jump with W, or with the respective arrow keys.
    3. The player characterâ€™s anticipated jump direction shall change if the left or right movement keys are pressed while charging a jump.
    4. The player shall not be allowed to jump while in midair.
    5. The player shall not carry momentum through movement or jumps.

# Non-Functional Requirements
